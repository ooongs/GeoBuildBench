# Define hypotenuse endpoints with AB length 3
point : 0 0 -> A
point : 3 0 -> B

# Segment and line AB (hypotenuse)
segment : A B -> AB
line : A B -> line_AB

# Midpoint of AB (center of circumcircle with diameter AB)
midpoint : A B -> M

# Construct C on the circle with diameter AB by rotating B about M by 30°
# This guarantees triangle ABC is right-angled at C
rotate : B 30° M -> C

# Sides of the right triangle
segment : A C -> AC
segment : B C -> BC

# Circle centered at C with radius 1 to enforce CP = 1
circle : C 1 -> circle_C1

# Intersection of this circle with line AB; define point P on AB with CP = 1
intersect : line_AB circle_C1 -> P Q

# Explicitly create segment CP to highlight the length condition
segment : C P -> CP
