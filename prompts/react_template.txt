You are solving a geometry problem. Follow the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern:

## Problem:
{problem_text}

## Your Goal:
Generate DSL code that creates a geometric construction matching the problem description.

## Instructions:

1. **Think** carefully about what geometric objects are needed
2. **Learn** from previous attempts - analyze what worked and what failed
3. **Act** by generating or modifying DSL code
4. **Observe** the results (image and any errors)
5. **Reflect** on whether the solution is correct and why previous attempts failed
6. **Iterate** until the construction is complete

## Key Principles:
- **If you see repeated errors**, try a completely different approach
- **If previous DSL had syntax errors**, carefully check the syntax before trying again
- **If the construction failed**, understand WHY it failed before modifying
- **Look at the rendered images** to see if the construction is geometrically correct
- **Pay attention to error messages** - they tell you exactly what went wrong

## Output Format:

ALWAYS structure your response EXACTLY like this:

**Thought:** [Your reasoning - what do you need to do next and why?]

**Action:** [choose: generate_dsl, modify_dsl, or final_answer]

[If generate_dsl or modify_dsl, provide DSL code:]
```
[Complete DSL code here]
```

[If final_answer:]
The construction is complete. The DSL successfully creates [describe what was created].

## Important Reminders:

- Define points BEFORE using them in lines/segments
- Use meaningful labels (line_AB not line1)
- **DO NOT** use constraint commands like `equality : angle 80` or `parallel : line1 line2`
- **DO** construct geometry to naturally have the desired properties
- Check the observation carefully for errors
- If there's an error, think about what caused it and how to fix it
- You can see the rendered image - use it to verify your construction!
- Pay attention to validation scores and failed conditions to improve your construction

## Previous Attempts:

{history}

## Learning from History:

**IMPORTANT**: Review the history above carefully:
- Look at which approaches succeeded and which failed
- Identify the root cause of errors (syntax, logic, missing objects)
- If you made the same mistake multiple times, try a different strategy
- If syntax errors occurred, double-check DSL syntax in this attempt
- Compare rendered images to see if you're making progress

## Common Mistakes to AVOID:

❌ **WRONG:**
```
angle : A B C -> angle_ABC
const int 80 -> angle_value
equality : angle_ABC angle_value -> expr1  # This doesn't work!
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```
point :  -> A
point :  -> B
point :  -> C
polygon : A B C -> triangle c a b
line : B C -> line_BC
point :  -> D
point :  -> E
line : D E -> line_DE
```

## CRITICAL Rules:

1. **Never redefine a variable** - Each label can only be defined once
2. **Use random points** - `point :  -> A` for unconstrained points  
3. **Fixed coordinates** - `point : 100 150 -> A` only if you need exact position
4. **Learn from validation feedback** - Check which conditions failed and improve your construction
